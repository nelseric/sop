Personal Notes:(if you have ideas or opinions on these please share)

*I want to alter the "canshoot" function right at the outset and seen how it changes the shooting behavior, namely
  if my alterations make the shooter too careful and causes too much hesitation.  I am wanting to underestimate the
  power needed to make a shot, and possibly lower the number of checks before giving up on the shot.  The desired
  change would be to check the positions quickly for a "sure thing", and if one is not immediately seen, pass it and
  try with that player.

  Update to canshoot:  Lowering the modifier in the MySoccerTeam.cpp paired with more agressive positioning yielded
     a noticable increase in the number of shots on goal and in turn more shots scored even if a few were blocked.

  Keeping at the level it is now, may try something more dramatic once all the areas are combined.
